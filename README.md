# Largest-palindrome-product
This spaghetti code is a bruteforce approach to the fourth problem from Project Euler.
A palindromic number reads the same both ways, this program is defined to output the largest palindrome number that can be obtained from multiplication of 2 3-digit numbers.

The next step is to let the user choose the number of digits.
